Bubble Sort:
Performance:
Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it for large datasets.
Best Case: O(n) This occurs when the list is already sorted, and no swaps are needed.
Worst Case: O(n^2) This occurs when the list is in reverse order, and many swaps are required.
Average Case: O(n^2) - On average, Bubble Sort requires quadratic time.
Selection Sort:
Performance:
Selection Sort also has a time complexity of O(n^2).
Like Bubble Sort, it is not for large datasets.
Best Case: O(n^2)This is because Selection Sort performs the same number of comparisons and swaps of the initial order.
Worst Case: O(n^2)The number of comparisons and swaps remains the same, making it for large datasets.
Average Case: O(n^2)On average, Selection Sort requires quadratic time.
Insertion Sort:
Performance:
Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case but can be for small datasets or partially sorted lists.
Best Case:O(n) This occurs when the list is nearly sorted, and few comparisons and shifts are needed.
Worst Case:O(n^2) This occurs when the list is in reverse order, and many comparisons and shifts are required.
Average Case: O(n^2) Insertion Sort typically performs at its worst for random orderings.
